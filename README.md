# MEGA Sekurak Hacking Party 2023  
## CTF Writeup  

This was my first time participating in MSHP - an Cybersecurity/Hacking event with CTF competition beforehand, organised by [Sekurak](https://sekurak.pl/). This year's CTF was meant to be RETRO-like, which basically meant exploring serious vulnerabilities from the past in very accessible form, with a twist.  

As usual, MSHP event brought together experienced professionals from the field of Cybersecurity, which was great opportunity to learn about new arising problems and exciting ways to solve them.
