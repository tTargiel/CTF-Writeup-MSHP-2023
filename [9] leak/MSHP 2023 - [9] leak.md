## Steps to solve  
Based on challenge description (which was published on *MSHP Discord server* one day before CTF started) I was able to guess that flag is to be seen somewhere in publicly available resources on **either Discord or CTF webpage**.  

Thorough investigation of *MSHP Discord server* subchannels brought no luck to me.  
However CTF webpage was more promising, can you see something interesting on the screenshot below?

I personally was very much interested in this "competition rules" button.  

And bingo! it was a hit - **CTRL+F** to search for **MSHP** revealed secret additional flag:

It seems that reading terms of the event can be sometimes beneficial.
