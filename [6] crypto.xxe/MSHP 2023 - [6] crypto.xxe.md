## Steps to solve
This challenge was different from the others. When I visited provided URL link, the only thing that could be seen was "Method Not Allowed" **HTTP 405** error message. Strange right?

I decided to look at full picture. I used *restninja.io* to send same GET request as my browser - it allowed me to see **RAW response and all headers** connected to this request:

And funnily enough that was almost all I needed to solve this challenge: **allow response header mentioned OPTIONS and POST**. That's why I sent POST request to the same URL address as before, and received this response:

One last thing to do was to decode this base64 string (as usual I used *CyberChef*):

**FLAG:** MSHP_{#5p5wBcZ@o69t$7}

## Additional comments
I have no idea what was the idea behind challenge description/hint. As I did nothing with /tmp/flag and still was able to retrieve the flag.
